Using Reinforcement Learning to Optimize Ice Machine Operations    

##### ice_env.py  
Defines the environment of an ice machine within 24 hours (an episode)  
Environment details:    

##### Q_Value_Agent1.py  
Defines the agent and how the agent act to interact with the environment defined  
Agent details:    

##### state.py  
Defines state at each ice produce cycle (an hour)    

##### runner.ipynb  
This is the jupyter notebook interface of the simulation, which will load the state, environment and the agent as a whole and run the simulation
